# Introduction to Cerbero

Cerbero is a Python-based packaging system for downloading, compiling, installing, and packaging GStreamer and all the libraries it uses. Instructions on how to do this for each component are codified in `recipe` files which are shipped with Cerbero itself. Cerbero can be used on Linux, OS X, and Windows, and can cross-compile for Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS. See the full [list of architectures and platforms](#supported-platforms).

The first step is to fetch the latest Cerbero from git:

    $ git clone http://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/sdk/cerbero.git cerbero.git
    $ cd cerbero.git

By default, this will build the latest git version of GStreamer. If you want to, for example, build the 1.8 stable release, you can checkout the `1.8` branch like so:

    $ git checkout 1.8

If you have multiple remotes, you will need to specify the pathspec and the branch name explicitly:

    $ git checkout -b 1.8 origin/1.8
    
You can switch back by doing:

    $ git checkout master

And so on.

## Directory Structure <a id="dir-structure"></a>

Out of all the files and directories inside the Cerbero git directory, the following are the important ones:

    cerbero.git/
      cerbero/
      cerbero-uninstalled
      config/
      packages/
      recipes/

`cerbero-uninstalled` is the [interface to Cerbero](#cli-usage).

`cerbero` contains the Python code that constitutes Cerbero.

`config` has the various "configurations" ([combinations of platforms and architectures](#supported-platforms)) on and for which Cerbero can be run.

`recipes` is where you'll find the `.recipe` files that fetch, build, and install the sources for a piece of software. These are in the form of a Python derived class that overrides methods for fetching, building, and installing. Please see the recipe documentation for details.

`packages` has `.package` files which list the files that each package will contain. Packages can be `.rpm`, `.deb`, `.framework`, `.msi` and `.msm`, just `.tar.bz2`, and so on. Each package file is supposed to list all the files necessary for making a particular set of libraries work. This will create two sets of packages: one contains runtime libraries and executables and the other will have development libraries and headers.

## Command-Line Interface <a id="cli-usage"></a>

Although Cerbero can be installed on your system using the bundled `Makefile`, the most common (and recommended) way to use it is by directly running it from the git repository as shown in the following commands.

Let's start with building GStreamer 1.x for the native platform and architecture. First, we must bootstrap the Cerbero build environment.

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled bootstrap

Next, we can build a specific recipe. Let's say, we only want the core GStreamer libraries and GStreamer base plugins

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled build gst-plugins-base-1.0

This will build all the recipes that are needed by `gst-plugins-base-1.0.recipe` (found in the `recipes` directory) and then build the recipe itself.

We can also build an entire package in one go. Such as the set of core GStreamer libraries and plugins:

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled package gstreamer-1.0-core

Or the entire set of GStreamer libraries and plugins:

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled package gstreamer-1.0

While on Linux, to cross-compile for Windows, you just need to add a `-c` argument specifying the appropriate configuration file to use:

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-win32.cbc package gstreamer-1.0

While on Windows, to build for 32-bit x86 using MinGW and the MSVC toolchain (wherever possible), the config file to use is:

    $ python2 cerbero-uninstalled -c config/win32-mixed-msvc.cbc package gstreamer-1.0

## Supported Architectures and Platforms <a id="supported-platforms"></a>

Support for LLVM/Clang on Linux and for GCC on OS X is easy to add if needed.

Cross-compilation targetting Windows is currently only available on Linux.

Of particular note is that while building natively on Windows with the use of Meson build files, Cerbero is able to build GStreamer and its core dependencies entirely with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. The full list of recipes that can use it are:

| Recipes that can use MSVC |
|---------------------------|
| bzip2.recipe |
| orc.recipe |
| libffi.recipe (only 32-bit) |
| glib.recipe |
| gstreamer-1.0.recipe |
| gst-plugins-base-1.0.recipe |
| gst-plugins-good-1.0.recipe |
| gst-plugins-bad-1.0.recipe |
| gst-plugins-ugly-1.0.recipe |

This feature is enabled by the use of `config/win32-mixed-msvc.cbc` as demonstrated in the previous section. By default if no configuration is specified the Meson build files use MinGW on Windows.

## Recipes <a id="recipe-format"></a>

A recipe describes the way a specific project (repository or source tarball) is configured, built, and installed. It specifies the URI for the source tree (http, git, etc), the build type (Autotools, CMake, Meson, Custom), the version number (only used while packaging), the dependencies (other recipes needed), patches, and so on.

#### Sample Recipe

```
class Recipe(recipe.Recipe):
    name = 'json-glib'
    version = '1.0.4'
    licenses = [License.LGPLv2_1Plus]
    btype = BuildType.AUTOTOOLS
    stype = SourceType.TARBALL
    url = 'http://download.gnome.org/sources/{0}/1.0/{0}-{1}.tar.xz'.format(name, version)
    patches = ['json-glib/0001-Don-t-override-our-own-ACLOCAL_FLAGS-but-append-them.patch']
    deps = ['glib']
```

As you can see, the syntax is similar to that of Python. In fact, it *is* Python. It's a simple class definition with attributes attached.

In technical terms, each recipe in the `recipes/` directory just extends the `recipe.Recipe` class defined in `cerbero/build/recipe.py`. The `metaclass` of the `recipe.Recipe` adds attributes based on the `btype` variable from classes in `cerbero/build/build.py` and based on the `stype` variable from classes in `cerbero/build/source.py`. There is more to it, but these are the two most important interactions.

#### Basic Attributes

`name` is the name of the recipe. The filename of the recipe does not matter at all. This variable is used as the name and it must be unique.

`version` is only used in build paths and has no other effect. It is still a good idea to keep it in sync with the project version.

`stype` is the source type to be fetched. The most common values are `TARBALL`, `GIT`, `SVN`, and `CUSTOM` (no sources to download).

`btype` is the build system type that will be used. Valid values are `MAKEFILE`, `AUTOTOOLS`, `CMAKE`, `MESON`, and `CUSTOM`. The default if unspecified is `AUTOTOOLS`.

`licenses` is a list of licenses. The full list of available licenses is in `cerbero/enums.py`.

`deps` is a list of recipe names that are needed for this recipe to be built.

Besides these basic attributes, there are other sourcetype-specific and buildtype-specific attributes. We will also look at the function attributes that can be defined in the recipe.

#### Extended Sample Recipe

```
class Recipe(recipe.Recipe):
    name = 'json-glib'
    version = '1.0.4'
    licenses = [License.LGPLv2_1Plus]
    btype = BuildType.AUTOTOOLS
    stype = SourceType.TARBALL
    url = 'http://download.gnome.org/sources/{0}/1.0/{0}-{1}.tar.xz'.format(name, version)
    patches = ['json-glib/0001-Don-t-override-our-own-ACLOCAL_FLAGS-but-append-them.patch']
    deps = ['glib']

    autoreconf = True
    #autoreconf_sh = './autogen.sh --noconfigure'
    configure_options = '--enable-static'
    #config_sh = './configure'

    files_bins = ['json-glib-validate', 'json-glib-format']
    files_libs = ['libjson-glib-1.0']
    files_devel  = ['include/json-glib-1.0', 'lib/pkgconfig/json-glib-1.0.pc']
    files_typelibs = ['Json-1.0']

    def prepare(self):
        self.append_env['CFLAGS'] = ' -Wno-error '
        if self.config.target_platform == Platform.WINDOWS:
            # Don't need autoreconf on MinGW so don't do it since it's very slow
            self.autoreconf = False
        if self.config.target_arch == Architecture.X86_64:
            self.append_env['CFLAGS'] += '-fno-omit-pointer '
```

#### More Attributes

`url` is only used when the `stype` is `TARBALL` and it defines a single HTTP(S) URL to download and extract for use as the source tarball. The supported compression formats are `tar` (`gzip`, `bzip2`, `xz`) and `zip`.

When the `stype` is GIT, two separate variables are used instead: `remotes` and `commit`. `remotes` is a `dict` of one or more git URLs from which to fetch the source. `commit` is a revision specification that points to something that can be checked out. This can be a branch, a tag, a specific commit, etc. For example:

```
remotes = {'origin' : 'git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer',
           'github: 'https://github.com/myorg/gstreamer.git'}
#commit = 'origin/master' (original value)
#commit = '1ed65e56' (a commit)
commit = 'github/my-work-branch'
```

`patches` is a list of patches that will be applied to the source tree after extraction. The path is relative to the recipe's directory.

`autoreconf` is used when `btype` is `AUTOTOOLS` and forces an autoreconf when set to `True`. Optionally, you can also specify a specific script to run for doing the autoreconf.

`configure_options` is used when `btype` is `AUTOTOOLS`, `MAKEFILE`, `CMAKE`, and `MESON`. Optionally, you can also specify the script that runs configure and takes these arguments with `config_sh`.

`files_*` variables define the executables (`files_bins`), libraries (`files_libs`), headers and pkg-config files and so on (`files_devel`), and typelibs `files_typelibs`. These control which files are copied into the packages (generated with the `package` command), and into which package (development or runtime). Besides these, there are several other file-related variables that are quite self-explanatory. Please see [gstreamer-1.0.recipe](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero/tree/recipes/gstreamer-1.0.recipe#n30) and [gst-plugins-bad-1.0.recipe](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero/tree/recipes/gst-plugins-bad-1.0.recipe#n37).

#### Recipe Methods

The `prepare` method on the class is run when the recipe is parsed and the recipe object has been created. This happens for all recipes known to Cerbero every time a command is run. It can set attributes on the recipe such as the environment to be used for it (`self.append_env`, it can modify the values of the instance attributes described above, and so on. It does not have access to the sources or the build result.

In the unlikely case that you need to intervene during the build process itself, you can override or extend the `configure`, `compile`, and `install` methods. The default implementations of these are defined in `cerbero/build/build.py` and depend on the `btype` of the recipe. The best way to understand how these work is by looking at examples such as [openh264.recipe](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero/tree/recipes/openh264.recipe).

If you want to make changes to the installed files after install, you can implement a method called `post_install`. The default implementation is to do nothing.

## Fetching and Extraction <a id="fetch-extract"></a>

For this entire section, it will be assumed that your Cerbero home is set to `~/cerbero`. You can change this value by adding `home_dir = '/some/path/to/dir'` to `~/.cerbero/cerbero.cbc`.

#### Fetch

If `stype` is `TARBALL`, either `wget` or `curl` is used to download the specified URL. If `stype` is `GIT`, `git` is used to fetch all the specified `remotes` and then the tree-ish specified in `commit` is checked out. All this is stored in `~/cerbero/sources/local`. The contents of this directory are shared between all architectures and configurations since it contains unmodified sources downloaded from remote servers.

#### Extract

The next step is to extract and patch these sources in a recipe-specific subdir inside a configuration-specific directory. This can be, for instance, `~/cerbero/sources/windows_x86/json-glib-1.0.4`. This same directory is later used for `configure`, `compile`, etc.

All this is done as part of the `fetch` and `extract` methods in the corresponding class in `cerbero/build/source.py`.

## Building and Logging <a id="building-logging"></a>

The standard build steps every project goes through are:

### `configure`

For Autotools this might involve running `autoreconf` (if `self.autoreconf = True`), followed by running `./configure` (or the value of `config_sh`).

For Meson, this means running `meson` which will generate the `build.ninja` file to actually build the project.

### `compile`

For Autotools this runs `make` (with or without a jobs `-j` argument depending on the configuration)

For Meson this runs `ninja` (or `ninja-build`)

### `install`

For Autotools this runs `make install` with the `DESTDIR` environment variable set.

For Meson this runs `ninja install` with the `DESTDIR` environment variable set.

In both cases, the `DESTDIR` env variable points to a configuration-specific directory inside the Cerbero home dir. This can be, for instance, `~/cerbero/dist/windows_x86` or `~/cerbero/dist/linux_x86_64`, and so on.

### `post_install`

By default, this method does nothing at all. If you wish to manipulate the installed files, you can implement it in your recipe.

### `gen_library_file`

On Windows, an extra step is run after `post_install`. This step generates import libraries.

When `btype` is `MESON` and the toolchain used is MSVC, this step creates `.dll.a` import libraries that are used by the MinGW toolchain for linking to the generated DLLs.

When `btype` is anything else, this step creates `.lib` import libraries that are needed by the MSVC toolchain for linking to the generated DLLs.

Note: MinGW can consume MSVC-style `.lib` import libraries too, but it is sometimes unable to resolve variables defined in them, so we always generate `.dll.a` import libraries since those don't have this problem.

### Logging
